#  Typeclasses

.caption[Daniel Beskin]
???
- In this talk we are going to discuss typeclasses
- Typeclasses are a functional "design pattern"
- It allows us to write extendible code at the right level of abstraction
- This pattern is very common in the Scala ecosystem
- Learning it will make various libraries easier to use

---
class: center, middle, transition

Motivation - Sorting

???
- First, a bit of motivation to get ourselves started
- The running example will be a generic sorting function
---
## Java-style - attempt #1
```
trait Orderable[A] {
  def compare(that: A): Int
}


{{content}}
```

???
- Here's a naive Java style attempt
- We define a `Orderable` trait for things that can be sorted by our function

--
def sort[A <: Orderable](xs: List[A]): List[A]


{{content}}
???
- Given a list of `Orderable`s, we can use their `compare` method to sort them
- For example:
--

case class Dog(name: String) extends Orderable[Dog] {
  def compare(that: Dog) = ???
}

???
- TODO better examples
- The problem with that approach is that it's not extensible
- If a type is not in our control, we can't make it `Orderable` after the fact
---

## Java-style - attempt #2

```
trait Oredring[A] {
  def compare(x: A, y: A): Int
}


{{content}}
```

???
- Taking out our design patterns book, the Adapter design pattern fits the bill
- It allows to adapt existing classes to our new abtraction
- We now define `Ordering` as a standalone entity

--
def sort[A](xs: List[A], ord: Ordering[A]): List[A]


{{content}}
???
- Sorting now takes an adapter parameter
- And so we can now adapt any existing class to our `Ordering` abstraction

--

case class Dog(name: String)


val dogOrdering = new Ordering[Dog] {
  def compare(x: Dog, y: Dog) = ???
}


sort(List(d1, d2, d3), dogOrdering)

???
- We now have an extinsble ordering, but the usage is a bit clumsy, we have
to pass these `Ordering` around
- Given that we use Scala, we can sprinkle some implicit magic to make a bit
nicer to use

---
## Java-semi-Scala-style - attempt #1

```
def sort[A](xs: List[A])(implicit ord: Ordering[A]): List[A]


{{content}}
```

--
implicit val dogOrdering = new Ordering[Dog] {
  def compare(x: Dog, y: Dog) = ???
}


sort(List(d1, d2, d3))

???
- Now we don't have to pass `Ordering`s around
- Once we make them implicit, the compiler will take care of passing them around for us
- And that's about 90% of typeclasses
- The typeclasses formalizes this pattern, and gives a bit more of a punch

- Motivation: Ordering adapter interface (5 min)
- Full definition: (5 min)
  * class definition
  * instance definition
  * operator syntax
- Benefits: (10 min)
  * Less typing (at use site)
  * Extensibility
  * Compiler composition (Ord[A] => Ord[List[A]])
  * Type-driven
  * Functional style (can abstract over construction of a type)
  * Abstract definition, many usages/code reuse (example: folding over monoids)
- Full example: add converters for typesafe config (show library that does it) (10 min)
- Examples in the wild (definitions and usage): (10 min)
  * Eq, Ord (standard library), Show
  * Numeric (standard library)
  * Parsing/serilization: JSON codecs (Play)
  * Algebraic: monoid, group (Spire)
  * Abstract: functor, applicative, monad (Scalaz, Cats)
- Extras: macro libraries for typeclass generation (shapeless, machinist) (5 min)
